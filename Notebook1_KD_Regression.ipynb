        "# Knowledge Distillation for Regression\n",
        "\n",
        " > **Note**: This notebook is part of an introductory project on Knowledge Distillation. It serves as a practical companion to the main presentation slides. The complete project is available on GitHub at: https://github.com/gabrielebilliciani/knowledge-distillation\n",
        "\n",
        "This notebook provides a practical demonstration of **Knowledge Distillation (KD)** applied to a regression task. The core principle of KD is to transfer \"knowledge\" from a large, complex, and high-performing **teacher** model to a smaller, more efficient **student** model. The goal is to enable the student to achieve performance that surpasses what it could learn on its own, thereby creating a model that is both accurate and computationally inexpensive.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Teacher & Student Architecture Philosophy\n",
        "\n",
        "We will design our models with distinct roles in mind:\n",
        "*   **Teacher Model:** A deep neural network (6-8 fully-connected layers) with a high capacity to learn complex mappings from the data. It will use advanced activation functions like **Leaky Rectified Linear Unit (LeakyReLU)** or **Exponential Linear Unit (ELU)** to capture nuanced patterns and prevent issues like dying neurons.\n",
        "*   **Student Model:** A much shallower network (2-3 fully-connected layers) using the standard **Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU)** activation. This model is designed for simplicity, faster inference, and a lower memory footprint, making it suitable for deployment in resource-constrained environments.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Distillation Loss Function\n",
        "\n",
        "To transfer knowledge, the student will be trained to optimise a composite loss function that combines signals from the ground truth data and the teacher's output predictions\n",
        "\n",
        "The combined loss function, $L$, is a weighted sum of two components:\n",
        "$$\n",
        "L = \\lambda_1 \\|y - y^{(s)}\\|^2 + \\lambda_2 \\|y^{(t)} - y^{(s)}\\|^2\n",
        "$$\n",
        "\n",
        "Where:\n",
        "*   **Term 1 (Hard Loss):** The standard regression loss (Mean Squared Error) between the **ground truth target** ($y$) and the **student's prediction** ($y^{(s)}$). This ensures the student learns the primary task. $\\lambda_1$ controls its weight.\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Term 2 ($L_{HP}$ - High Precision Distillation):** The L2 distance between the **teacher's prediction** ($y^{(t)}$) and the **student's prediction** ($y^{(s)}$). This is the classic distillation signal, where the student mimics the teacher's output. These \"soft targets\" from the teacher provide richer information than the hard ground truth labels alone.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Notebook Goal\n",
        "\n",
        "In this experiment, we will:\n",
        "1.  Define and pre-train a powerful teacher model on a dataset.\n",
        "2.  Train a simple student model from scratch as a baseline.\n",
        "3.  Train a second student using Hard Loss and $L_{HP}$ distillation (Terms 1 & 2).\n",
        "4.  Compare the performance of all models on a held-out test set to evaluate the effectiveness of each distillation technique."

        "\n",
        "The results from our first experiment show a slight improvement. On average, the distilled student achieved a lower Mean Squared Error (0.3357) compared to the student trained from scratch (0.3436). However, this improvement of 2.32% was not found to be statistically significant over the five runs (p-value = 0.1857). This suggests that while there might be a small benefit, the \"knowledge\" from the standard teacher isn't consistently strong enough to elevate the student significantly.\n",
        "\n",
        "This leads to a key question: **If we use an even better teacher, can we produce an even better student?**\n",
        "\n",
        "### Hypothesis\n",
        "\n",
        "Our new hypothesis is that by enhancing the teacher's architecture with techniques that improve generalisation (like **Dropout**) and learning capacity (like **LeakyReLU** and **Batch Normalisation**), we can create an \"Expert Teacher\". Distilling from this expert teacher should yield a student that is significantly better than both the scratch baseline *and* the student distilled from the standard teacher.\n",
        "\n",
        "To test this, we will now:\n",
        "1.  Define a new `ExpertTeacherNet`.\n",
        "2.  Train it on our complex task.\n",
        "3.  Distil its knowledge into a new student, **ensuring the student starts from the exact same initial weights as in Part 1** for a fair comparison.\n",
        "4.  Compare the performance of all models."

        "\n",
        "### Analysis of new results\n",
        "The results from Part 2 are definitive: using a more powerful, regularised **Expert Teacher** provides a substantial and statistically significant improvement. This confirms our main hypothesis that a better teacher makes a better student.\n",
        "\n",
        "However, the distillation process itself used a fixed, heuristic weight balance (`hard_loss`: 0.3, `hp_loss`: 0.7). This ratio was chosen intuitively, but is it optimal?\n",
        "\n",
        "### Next steps\n",
        "The balance between learning from the ground truth (`hard_loss`) and mimicking the teacher's predictions (`hp_loss`) is a critical hyperparameter. By systematically searching for the best balance, we can further improve the student's performance beyond our initial guess.\n",
        "\n",
        "To test this, we will perform a grid search. For each run and for each weight combination, we will:\n",
        "1.  Load the pre-trained **Expert Teacher** from the previous experiment.\n",
        "2.  Initialize a **brand-new student** using the *exact same starting weights* as all other students in this notebook.\n",
        "3.  Train this student using the same **early stopping** mechanism used for all other models to ensure a fair comparison. The model that performs best on the validation set will be selected.\n",
        "4.  Evaluate its performance on the final test set and average the results across all `N_RUNS` to find the most effective weighting strategy."

        "The grid search results are insightful. While giving a heavy weighting to the teacher's predictions (e.g., `HP=0.9`) yields a strong performance, the optimal balance was found at `H=0.3_HP=0.7`. This suggests that while the teacher's knowledge is highly valuable, grounding the student in the ground truth data is still crucial for achieving the best possible performance. Simply mimicking the teacher is not enough; a blend of both signals is key.\n",

        "Of course, this is highly dependent on the task at hand: this notebook is a toy example and as often happens in machine learning, the results may not generalise to other tasks. However, the principles of knowledge distillation and the importance of teacher quality remain valid across various domains."

        "\n",
        "This experiment has demonstrated a case where knowledge distillation can successfully improve the performance of a smaller student model in a regression task. The most effective strategy in this particular setup was to:\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Train a highly capable and well-regularised Teacher model.** A better teacher provides higher-quality \"soft targets\", leading to a better student.\n",
        "2.  **Perform response-based distillation (`L_HP`).** This classic technique proved robust and effective.\n",
        "3.  **Carefully tune the distillation hyperparameters.** A grid search revealed that the optimal balance between learning from the ground truth (`hard_loss`) and mimicking the teacher (`hp_loss`) was critical for maximising performance.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is worth noting that this notebook is a simplified example. In our broader explorations, we also experimented with adding other distillation signals, such as matching input gradients or intermediate feature representations. However, their effect was not consistently positive and did not yield a clear improvement over the tuned `L_HP` method, so they were not included here for clarity.\n",
        "\n",
        "Based on our experiments, we have gathered several insights for practitioners interested in applying distillation to regression:\n",
        "\n",
        "*   **Task Complexity Matters:** We observed no significant improvements from distillation on overly simple tasks. The problem needs to be complex enough that the teacher can learn \"dark knowledge\"—a mapping that is richer than the ground truth labels alone.\n",
        "*   **Teacher Quality is Paramount:** As demonstrated, a more powerful teacher leads to a better distilled student.\n",
        "*   **Student Capacity is Important:** The student model must have sufficient capacity to capture the nuances of the teacher's predictions. If the student is too small, it may not be able to benefit from the richer signal.\n",
        "*   **Statistical Validation is Crucial:** In some experiments, a single run of distillation showed significant improvements. However, when repeated for statistical validation, we found that on average, training from scratch could sometimes achieve a comparable performance. The inherent randomness in training can be a significant confounding factor, and a single successful run should be treated with caution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ultimately, we have not found distillation in regression to be as universally and dramatically effective as it often is in classification tasks. This is consistent with the literature, where distillation is much more commonly and successfully applied to classification. Indeed, in our own classification experiments, we achieved excellent results, which can be seen in the following notebooks:\n",
        "*   [Notebook 2: Distillation for Classification](link-to-notebook-2)\n",
        "*   [Notebook 3: Advanced Distillation Techniques](link-to-notebook-3)\n",
        "\n",
        "Knowledge distillation remains something of an art: you need to experiment and find the right balance of models, data, and techniques for your specific task to achieve optimal results."
